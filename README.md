# ChurnPrediction

This example uses customer data from a bank to build a predictive model for the likely churn clients. As we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than to keep an existing one. It is advantageous for banks to know what leads clients to leave the company. Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.

The data file Churn_modelling.csv contains 12 features about 10000 clients of the bank.
The features or variables are the following:
1) customer_id, unused variable.
2) credit_score, used as input.
3) country, used as input.
4) gender, used as input.
5) age, used as input.
6) tenure, used as input.
7) balance, used as input.
8) products_number, used as input.
9) credit_card, used as input.
10) active_member, used as input.
11) estimated_salary, used as input.
12) churn, used as the target. 1 if the client has left the bank during some period or 0 if he/she has not.
