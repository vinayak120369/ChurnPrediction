# Churn Prediction
This example uses customer data from a bank to build a predictive model for the likely churn clients. As we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than to keep an existing one. It is advantageous for banks to know what leads clients to leave the company. Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.

The data file Churn_Modelling.csv contains 12 features and about 10000 clients of the bank.
The features or variables are the following:
1) customer_id
2) credit_score
3) country
4) gender
5) age
6) tenure
7) balance
8) products_number
9) credit_card
10) active_member
11) estimated_salary
12) churn, used as the target. 1 if the client has left the bank during some period or 0 if he/she has not.

The algorithms used are:
a) Decision Trees
b) AdaBoost, Boosting algorithm
